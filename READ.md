## 2. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-overview"></a>

This project focuses on analyzing carbon emission data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform policy decisions and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions across different regions, sectors, and time periods.

#### Problem Statement
+ Agriculture, a vital sector for human sustenance and livelihood, is a contributing to the global warming crisis by emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), which exacerbate climate change. 
+ The agriculture sector is responsible for approximately 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the majority coming from the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. 
+ As temperatures continue to rise, agriculture is not only vulnerable to climate-related disruptions but also a significant contributor to the problem.

## 3. Objectives <a class="anchor" id="objectives"></a>
+ To identify the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions in agriculture.
+ To develop a set of recommendations for policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders on how to promote sustainable agriculture practices.
+ Develop machine learning models to predict temperature variations in different regions and identify which model is more effective.


## 4. Data Source  <a class="anchor" id="data-source"></a>


## 5. Methodology  <a class="anchor" id="methodology"></a>
+ Data Collection: Aggregating data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset.
+ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to identify key trends and patterns.
+ Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to understand correlations and causations.
+ Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms to forecast future emissions.
+ Visualization: Creating interactive and static visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

## 6. Tools And Technologies  <a class="anchor" id="tools-and-technologies"></a>

+ Programming Languages: Python
+ Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, StatsModels
+ Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
+ Version Control: Git, GitHub

## 7. Significance <a class="anchor" id="significance"></a>

Addressing climate change requires an understanding of carbon emissions. In order to help the public, researchers, and policymakers better understand the dynamics of carbon emissions and take proactive steps to lessen their effects, this project seeks to provide insightful information. We can better plan and execute strategies to meet sustainability targets and lessen global warming by analyzing and forecasting emissions.

## 8. Expected Outcomes  <a class="anchor" id="expected-outcomes"></a>
+ Comprehensive reports and dashboards that show trends in carbon emissions.
+ Predictive models with the ability to project emissions in a variety of scenarios.
+ Recommendations for policies derived from data-driven insights.
+ Datasets and open-source code for additional study and examination.
